### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm currently working as a SRE for Kroger Technology, trying to learn and push myself everyday to grow my career and be impactful to those around me.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on providing direction and leadership to my team as we move several applications (and many more to come) into Azure

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang, lots and lots of golang, with a little bit of terraform sprinkled in for fun.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on OSS that I use, or plan to use in the future. Anything ansible related, and once i gain more confidence in my skills with the language, golang!
